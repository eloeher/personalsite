<p>*while cleaning up copyright issues in the fall of 2024, the E3W has taken all old articles off its site temporarily. i've attached ugly plaintext copies on this site. i coded this whole thing myself (that is probably not something to brag about) and didn't have time to make the pages pretty.</p>
