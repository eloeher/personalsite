    <h2>Report: Hinge 'Designed To Be Deleted' Because It Full Of Uggos</h2>
<p>A new report from the University of Chicago states that popular dating app Hinge, whose tagline is “the app that’s designed to be deleted,” is advertised as so because it is “chock-full of uggos.”</p>

<p>“We just want people to find the one that makes them delete dating apps forever,” commented CEO Justin McLeod. “Until now, people have assumed that means ‘the one’, but really, we meant swiping until you throw your phone after seeing an absolute troglodyte.”</p>

<p>“Hinge is awesome, because not only do I get to see pictures of all the twos-through-fives in my area, the cute prompts also give me a glimpse into their lack of personalities,” reported user Lucas Upton. </p>

<p>Fellow user Belle Schiller reported that the app’s “complete lack of hotties with bodies” was actually shaping up to be a good thing. “After an hour of bad selfie after bad selfie, I deleted the app and decided to put that time into applying for PhD programs.”</p>

<p>At press time, eighty-six percent of Hinge users were seen going back to their exes after declaring “they can’t be worse than these fuglies.”</p>
