<p>Area Catholic Walter O’Connor has decided to give up his senses of taste and smell in observance of the Lenten season.</p>

<p>O’Connor reportedly valiantly gave up the two senses shortly after attending a 100-person Mardi Gras party. Mardi Gras is a holiday known for celebrating all the vices before the beginning of the Lenten season, which for O’Connor meant his senses of smell and taste.</p>

<p>The devout O’Connor allegedly also noticed chills, which were easily attributed to the presence of the Holy Spirit around him. </p>

<p>“You know, I was thinking about just completely giving up leaving the house and seeing other people,” reported O’Connor. “I don’t know if I could do that for the next forty days, but at least for the next 10-14.”</p>

<p>Later, O’Connor’s priest, Fr. Forrest, lauded the man for his incredible sacrifice during this Lent: “You know, it’s not often that we have someone so committed to the faith that they’re willing to give up two specific senses. Walter really has the spirit of Christ in his heart.” </p>
