<h2>Graduating Friend Announces Plans To “Change Raytheon From The Inside”</h2>
<p>Soon-to-be College of Engineering graduate Vicky Albertson has reportedly been telling all her friends that she’s looking forward to “changing the culture from the inside” at her full-time Aerospace Engineering job at Raytheon this coming fall. </p>

<p>Albertson, whose friends initially questioned her decision to work at a weapons manufacturer, happily reassured them that she “wasn’t, like, morally endorsing” the rockets and drones she’d be building, and that she was “looking to make some real, systemic alterations.”</p>

<p>After questioning from fellow engineering students, Albertson somewhat conceded. “Look, I know I’m not going to be able to change things overnight, but I think if I can really rise through the ranks, stay quiet as thousands of civilians get struck by drones, and shut down the entire reason the company’s profitbale, I could change things.” </p>

<p>“Plus,” continued Albertson, “I’m going to be one of the only female engineers on my team. If anything, this is a reminder of how far women in STEM fields still have to go.”</p>

<p>Albertson’s roommate recently announced her plans to consult with big pharmaceutical companies– “but, like, strictly financially”-- at McKinsey in the spring.</p>
